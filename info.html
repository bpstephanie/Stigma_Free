                    <p>Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection in Sweden. 
                        A chlamydia infection rarely causes any symptoms and half of those who get chlamydia do not notice it.</p>
                </div><br>
                <div class="symptoms">
                    <h3 class="symptoms-subheader">Symptoms</h3>
                    <p>If you get symptoms, they vary depending on where the infection is. 
                        If it is in the penis/vagina, you may experience discharge and/or pain when you urinate.
                         If you have Chlamydia in your anus, you can get discharges from there. 
                          Chlamydia in the throat can cause similar symptoms to strep throat and is difficult to pass on, and usually it heals on its own.</p>

                    <h3 class="risk-of-transmission-subheader">Risk of Transmission</h3>
                    <p>Chlamydia is easily transmitted through mucous membranes and body fluids. 
                        The mucous membrane is found on the glans on the penis, in the vagina, the anus and in the mouth, and that is where you can get chlamydia. 
                         Chlamydia is transmitted most easily during vaginal and anal sex, but also during oral sex with a penis. 
                          The risk of transmitting chlamydia to the throat during oral sex with a vagina or anus is small, even without protection.
                           There is a small risk of Chlamydia being transmitted via hands or sex toys between different peoples genitals and the anus. 
                            By avoiding transferring bodily fluids from one person to another, for example by washing hands and changing condoms on sex toys, the risk of this is reduced.</p>

                    <p>Testing should be done on the parts of the body where you had sex. 
                        Tests for Chlamydia in the penis is usually taken with a urine sample, for people with a vagina, a urine sample is combined with sampling with a cotton swab in the vagina. 
                        Samples in the throat and anus are also taken with a swab. 
                        The sampling takes a couple of seconds.</p>

                        Infection in the anus can lead to a burning sensation and bleeding.

                        Gonorrhea in the urethra can also be tested with a urine sample, which is easier than a swab test. The swab testing can be experienced as uncomfortable. 
                         If the urine sample shows that Gonorrhoea is present in the urethra, one must follow up with a swab test to ensure what type of Gonorrhoea it is to be able to start the right treatment.</p>

                    <p>Gonorrhea is treated either with a single dose of antibiotics through an injection into a muscle, usually in the thigh or buttock, or with tablets. 
                        The treatment may look a little different depending on where on the body the bacteria is and if the bacteria is resistant to certain types of antibiotics. 
                         Antibiotic resistant Gonorrhoea is an increasing problem, so a follow-up is always done to see that the treatment has worked.</p>

                          Trichomoniasis in men can cause pain when peeing or during ejaculation, needing to pee more frequently than usual, thin, white discharge from the penis, soreness, swelling and redness around the head of the penis or foreskin.</p>

                    <p>The parasite is usually spread by having sex without using a condom. 
                        It could also be spread by sharing sex toys if you do not wash them or cover them with a new condom before use. 
                         You do not have to have many sexual partners to catch trichomoniasis. 
                          Anyone who's sexually active can catch it and pass it on.
                           It can also be spread by kissing, hugging, sharing foodware and by toilet seats.</p>

                        If you have a vagina, warts can be on the labia, around the urethra and in the vaginal entrance. They can also sit further into the vagina and on the cervix and can then be difficult to detect. 
                         You can also get warts in and around the anus. HPV can be transmitted to the mouth and throat. The warts can hurt, but usually they cause no discomfort.

                           These types of HPV can cause cell changes on and in the cervix, in the anus and in the throat, which can eventually lead to cancer. </p>

                          For many, the blisters usually comes when you have a cold, are stressed or have a weakened immune system. Some people who get Herpes get a primary infection that makes them sick with fever, pain and swollen lymph nodes. 
                           Subsequent relapses tend to be milder. In rare cases, the virus can also attack other parts of the body that require different care and treatment.</p>

                    <p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that weakens the body's immune system and was discovered around 1980. 
                        Today, most of the people who are HIV positive in Sweden have access to good and effective treatment, but HIV still cannot be cured. 
                         Despite improved treatment options, there are many medical and personal consequences of living with HIV. 
                          If you do not know your HIV status, it is a good idea to get regularly tested, get treatment, if needed, and stop the risk of you transmitting the virus to someone else.</p>

                        A primary infection means that you get sick, some people do not get very sick while others have strong symptoms, like a bad flu, and need to seek emergency care. 
                         After a couple of weeks, the primary infection subsides, but the lymph nodes are usually still swollen.

                    <p>HIV is most commonly transmitted through unprotected anal and vaginal intercourse and through sharing needles. 
                        It can also be transmitted from birth parent to child; HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding people who are not receiving treatment can transmit the infection to the child.
                         Oral sex carries a small risk of transferring HIV.
                          Compared to many other diseases, HIV is not very easily transmitted as the virus cannot survive in the air.
                           In order for HIV to be transmitted between people, it requires a certain level of the virus to be present, so if you are HIV positive and have an effective treatment, you will have an insufficient level of the virus in your body to transmit it to someone else. 
                            Most people that contract HIV are infected by someone who does not know that they have HIV.
                             The best way to avoid HIV being transmitted is to use condoms when having intercourse, not let your mouth come in contact with sperm, and not share needles. 
                              Everyone shares the responsibility to protect ourselves and others, regardless of whether we are living with HIV or not.</p>

                    <p>There are very effective treatments that prevent the HIV positive person from getting sick, but unfortunately the disease cannot be cured.
                        Many who test positive start treatment quickly, often within a couple of weeks. The medications have improved and the adverse effects have been reduced dramatically.
                         It is still common to experience side effects in the beginning of treatment, but they usually subside.</p>

                    <p>Most people who have HIV can live long and feel well. 
                        Most have undetectable viral loads, making it impossible to transmit HIV to someone else.
                         Rapid HIV tests are relatively new in Sweden, and are not yet readily available in general healthcare. A rapid test is taken through pricking a finger and testing a few drops of blood. Results are usually ready within 15 minutes.
                          Just like with traditional testing, you are referred to an HIV specialist.
                           You can get a rapid test at RFSL or some of the other independent clinics in the larger cities. 
                            If you test positive at RFSL, you will get assistance in contacting healthcare, but if you test positive abroad then will have to contact an HIV specialist yourself.
                             If you test positive in a rapid test, an additional traditional blood test is taken.</p>
